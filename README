README for Kiwi source from SUSE Studio
------------------------------------------------

This tarball contains the Kiwi configuration, theming and overlay files that
were exported from SUSE Studio (http://susestudio.com). It allows you to
create your SUSE Studio configured appliance on your local system.

The user is expected to be familiar with using Kiwi. Details on Kiwi can be
found at http://kiwi.berlios.de.

We recommend installing the version of Kiwi found in the openSUSE
Virtualization:Appliances repository, eg:

  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances/<distro_version>

Please send all your questions and feedback to feedback@susestudio.com.

 create_appliance.sh - Helper script to create your appliance.

The create_appliance.sh script simplifies the applicance creation by
automatically running the kiwi prepare and create steps.

It also prompts users to enter the URLs for internal repositories used by the
appliance (eg. SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories) and updates the
bootsource/config.xml and source/config.xml files accordingly. Backups of these
config files are made to config.xml.bak in the respective directories if
modifications are made by the script.

The script warns the user if the installed kiwi version does not match the
expected version. Minor version differences should be tolerable.


----------------------
Creating your appliance
----------------------
Simply run the create_appliance.sh script as root, eg:

  sudo ./create_appliance.sh


If your appliance uses internal (non-public) repositories, you will be prompted
to specify the repo URL before continuing, eg:

  > sudo ./create_appliance.sh
  ** Checking for internal repositories...
  Enter repository URL for 'SLES 11 i386': http://my.repository/path/to/repo


A successful run looks like this:

  > sudo ./create_appliance.sh
  ** Checking for internal repositories...

  ** Creating appliance...
  rm -rf build/root
  mkdir -p build image
  /usr/bin/linux32 /usr/sbin/kiwi --prepare source --root build/root ...

  ** Appliance created successfully! (image/James_JeOS_32bit.i686-0.0.1.raw)
  To boot the image using qemu-kvm, run the following command:
    qemu-kvm -snapshot -m 512 image/James_JeOS_32bit.i686-0.0.1.raw &


You can tail the respective log files during the appliance creation to observe
the details of the kiwi operation. For example:

  tail -f boot-prepare.log


----------------------
Troubleshooting
----------------------

You may need to manually edit bootsource/config.xml and source/config.xml to
remove repositories that are not available or failing in your environment.

For example, to remove the 'openSUSE 11.1 Updates' repositories, remove the
following lines from both config.xml:

  <repository type='rpm-md'>
    <source path='http://download.opensuse.org/update/11.1/'/>
  </repository>
